#  README

Thank you for giving this opportunity. I timed myself to 5 hours and this is the result. 
I was able to set up the file to unit test the logic
Things I did not get to:
I wish there was more time to further develop CRUD operation. A new Key will be created for the list of previous user
They Key will be an array of [String] that will be displayed as the history
The images are coming out small, dealing with images is always time consuming getting it right for all screens
Did not have time to test the error handling, hopefully it works, ran out of time
Also creating a card for the array of cities needs to be done
Objects are created are testable
